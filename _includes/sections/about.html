    <h3>I work as a data librarian in Ithaca, New York. </h3>
    <p>
    In 2011, I started teaching adult learners from diverse backrounds how to double-click, browse Wikipedia, and  enter functions into Excel. 
    </p><p>
    Six years later, I still love helping learners work towards their goals with technology, but I draw upon a different toolkit: developing web applications, consulting with clients from diverse backgrounds and with varying levels of technical expertise, mentoring young developers, and writing.
</p>
<p>
    As the <b>Social Science and Geospatial Data Librarian at Cornell University</b>, I specialize in helping learners and researchers find & interpret data across the social sciences, including supporting those who are new to digital methods. My techniques of choice include manipulating complex & messy datasets, data visualization, text mining, and generally using Python and other programming languages to pursue research questions.
</p>

<h3>I'm also a data scientist and full-stack web developer.</h3>
<p>In particular, I focus on critical applications of data science, open source packages and software, machine learning, and natural language processing.</p>
<h4>Key methodologies:</h4>
<p>Exploratory data analysis; natural language processing; web application development; data skills instruction with learners with diverse backgrounds; data visualization and storytelling; technical writing</p>
<h4>Key technical skills:</h4>
<p>Python (pandas, pyspark, jupyter, etc.) and R (tidyverse); SQL; web app development (django, flask, HTML/CSS, JavaScript); visualization (d3, seaborn, bokeh, Tableau); machine learning & nlp (scikit-learn, Spark, TensorFlow); and open source collaboration (git/github).</p>
<h4>Learning-in-progress:</h4>
<p>Spark and Hadoop architecture, intermediate/advanced JavaScript, test-driven development best practices, contributing more pull requests to FOSS projects</p>   
<hr >
<h3> I'm into a bunch of other stuff too!</h3>
<p>
    Outside of work I love writing, pinball, zines, hikes, cats, speculative fiction, and trains.</p>
